**Overview of project**

Built to further my knowledge of ruby on rails, javascript and ajax, ShipWrecked is a website built for people who enjoy writing collaboratively together, or participating in online roleplay forums. 

ShipWrecked allows writers and roleplayers to manage their characters, goals, milestones and ongoing plot threads, as well as collaborate with other writers and discuss plots and suggested ideas.

It enables users to create and manage their character's goals, milestones, threads and relationships. A built-in dashboard makes it easy to track completion of these items, while a biography page helps to maintain a consistent character personality and history.

ShipWreck includes a custom built kanban board to help users keep track of their thread statuses and progress. At the moment, columns are fixed, but in the future will be customisable. This was built using sortable.js and stimulus.js to enable live changes to be posted to the database.

There is also a built-in communication feature that enables friends to reach out to each other and discuss potential plot themes and ideas, built using action cable.
